<p> This company was founded in 1862 with one goal in mind. Give people books. We didn’t care how we would get them to people
Or who wanted them. If you wanted a book we would get it for you. Even if it didn’t exist, we would travel to a universe where that book did exist, "acquire it"
And pass the savings onto you. What separates us from our competitors is our Patented Trans-Dimensional Steam powered canoe. With this we can travel to any time 
And/or universe and get you the book of your dreams. You want a book on the battle of the flying pigs? We can acquire it! You want a book on the history of Zombie Emperor Zed? We can acquire it!
And don’t forget our motto! “If you can think of it, it’s already been written and its better than anything you could of come up with"</p>
